TODO
====

* infer master branch when needed: https://github.com/mikechabot/cross-env-example/pull/1#issue-139341424
  * will probably need to add `/tree/master` to the path
* don't permalink badges: https://github.com/kentcdodds/cross-env
* Use e.g. `git log -S` to guess when links were added.
  * For example, the `more...` permalink here is broken: https://github.com/nice-registry/nice-package#nice-package---
* Figure out what's going on with 96bd92ba935682d06693c47775b93dec32d019c2
* Link both gist content and comments. See getGistFilesAndDatetimes usage
