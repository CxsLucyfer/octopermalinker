====

* don't link again when back button is pressed. See https://github.com/OctoLinker/injection/issues/2
* permanentize links in markdown blobs as well (README.md, etc)
  * example: https://gist.github.com/HaNdTriX/77916f3fcdd7d285f7c9#what-i-already-got
* detect when impermanent links are pasted, and fix them
