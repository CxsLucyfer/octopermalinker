TODO
====

* don't add/change link if it's already permanent
  * example (click-handler / Github links): https://github.com/OctoLinker/browser-extension/issues/113#issue-163053327
* add tests
* test in browsers using domify and/or jsdomify instead of jsdom?
* permanentize links in markdown blobs as well (README.md, etc)
  * example: https://gist.github.com/HaNdTriX/77916f3fcdd7d285f7c9#what-i-already-got
* detect when impermanent links are pasted, and fix them
